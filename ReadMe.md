# Introduction

The goal of this classification project was to predict whether a person would submit a claim or not.  
Multiple permutations of several models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost did not produce significant results and therefore we must conclude the data is not predictive.  However, we did learn which features appear useful and can begin to focus energy on collecting more data for those.  We can also work on identifying new data points and feature engineering to produce a data set that will be predictive and answer our questions with confidence.
